## Mod description

This mod allows unloading bales beyond a configurable threshold (default: 10%)

The mod works for:
- Round balers (including poplar bio balers)
- Square balers (only when turned off)
- Round baler/wrapper combinations
- One-Chamber Cotton Harvesters
- Two chamber balers (cotton harvesters, nonstop balers)

The threshold can be configured in the general settings (only admins can do that in multiplayer)

This mod is based on the idea of FS19's ["UnfinishedBales"](https://github.com/Mogli12/UnfinishedBales) mod by mogli12 but was developed from scratch for FS22 and converted to FS25 by Farmsim Tim.

The icon is build from the following elements:
- [Baler icons created by Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/baler)
- [Hay icons created by Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/hay)
