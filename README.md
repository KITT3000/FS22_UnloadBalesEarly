# FS22_UnloadBalesEarly

## Mod description

This mod allows unloading bales beyond a configurable threshold (default: 10%)

The mod works for:
- Round balers (including poplar bio balers)
- Square balers (only when turned off)
- Round baler/wrapper combinations
- One-Chamber Cotton Harvesters

The threshold can be configured in the general settings (only admins can do that in multiplayer)

This mod is based on the idea of FS19's ["UnfinishedBales"](https://github.com/Mogli12/UnfinishedBales) mod by mogli12 but was developed from scratch for FS22.
